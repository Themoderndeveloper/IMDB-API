# PENN Movie API Python project

PENN Interactive API Project

This project requires that the large JSON file that is available at: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/6zykzcqzzrw5q7h/data.json?dl=0 

Place the file at the root of a C drive or update the path in the file to a different location:
 
movie_data.py
Line 10 - with open('C:\\data.json') as file

There is a bug in the nested JSON Dictionary for multiple movie records.

All API calls work from the Home Page Links when the API server is started by running:
app.py
